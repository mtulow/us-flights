Data visualization project for Udacity Business Analytics Nanodegree featuring the kaggle Flight Delays and Cancellations dataset.

Optional Questions:
1. __Which airlines or airports have the worst delays?__ Determine which destinations and arrival destinations have the most delays. Doing this using maps is actually pretty difficult, but you may choose an alternative visual to provide this information. Think about what kind of aggregates might work best to determine which airlines and airports are the best and worst in terms of delays.
2. __What causes delays?__ Think about if you work at an airline and you want to decrease delays. What part of the flight causes the most delays? Do these causes vary by airport or time of year?
3. As you work with the data, come up with a question you're curious about and can be answered from the data. Build a dashboard or story to answer your question and lead viewers to that answer.
